You are an expert in document reconstruction for RAG applications. Your task is to improve a document chunk 
by addressing specific quality issues identified in an evaluation, making it self-contained and useful on its own.

Full document:
---
{document}
---

Original chunk:
---
{chunk}
---

Quality issues to address:

1. Structural Issues: {boundary_issues}
   /* These are issues where the chunk cuts off mid-sentence/paragraph or begins without proper context.
      Example format: ["Chunk cuts off mid-paragraph before completing the description of X",
                      "Missing conclusion of section Y that appears in the document"] */

2. Missing Context: {missing_context}
   /* This includes document-level framing that should be present in every chunk.
      Example format: ["Document is about Company X's financial report for Q2 2024",
                       "Analysis is limited to North American operations only"] */

3. Unresolved References: {unresolved_references}
   /* References like pronouns or terms that need definitions from outside the chunk.
      Example format: ["'This approach' refers to the XYZ methodology described earlier",
                       "'Their findings' refers to the research team at University ABC"] */

4. Missing Prerequisites: {missing_prerequisites}
   /* Knowledge from earlier sections needed to understand this chunk.
      Example format: ["Definition of term X from Section 2.1",
                      "Context about the baseline measurement described in the introduction"] */

5. Recommendations: {recommendations}
   /* Specific suggestions from the evaluation phase.
      Example format: ["Include the document title and section context",
                      "Add the first sentence from paragraph 3 to resolve references"] */

GLOBAL CONTEXT GUIDELINES:
- Every chunk should ideally include document-level metadata (title, author, date if available)
- For technical documents, include relevant scope limitations or assumptions
- If the document has a specific audience or purpose, include that in each chunk

YOUR TASK: Create an improved version of the chunk that addresses these issues by:
1. Extending boundaries to include complete sentences, paragraphs, or concepts
2. Adding necessary context from the document
3. Resolving references by including their antecedents
4. Including required prerequisites from other parts of the document
5. Following the improvement recommendations

Important guidelines:
- Preserve the original information and style
- Only add information that exists in the full document
- Focus on making the chunk self-contained
- Keep the chunk focused on its primary topic
- Target an optimal chunk size of 300-1000 words (use judgment based on content)
- Prioritize fixing critical issues first if addressing all would make the chunk too long
- Format the chunk with proper Markdown if the original uses headings/lists/etc.
